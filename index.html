    <p>Microgreens as type of food are winning the nutrition race across the board. 
       A thorough 2012 study published by the Journal of Agricultural and Food 
       Chemistry (July) analyzed the vitamin concentrations in 25 varieties of commercially 
       available microgreens.  Lucky for us, they analyzed the vitamin content of green daikon radish, 
       China Rose Radish, and opal radish.  The study determined that the varieties of radish are high 
       in vitamin K, Vitamin C, Beta Carotein, and Vitamin E.  Green Daikon radish is especially high 
       in Vitamin E!</p>
